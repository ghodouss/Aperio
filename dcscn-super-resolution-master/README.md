## Overview

This is a tensorflow implementation of ["Fast and Accurate Image Super Resolution by Deep CNN with Skip Connection and Network in Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05425), a deep learning based Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) model. We named it **DCSCN**.

The model structure is like below. We use Deep CNN with Residual Net, Skip Connection and Network in Network. A combination of Deep CNNs and Skip connection layers is used as a feature extractor for image features on both local and global area. Parallelized 1x1 CNNs, like the one called Network in Network, is also used for image reconstruction.

## Sample result

Our model, DCSCN is much lighter than other Deep Learning based SISR models. Here is a comparison chart of performance vs computation complexity from our paper.

## Requirements

python > 3.5

tensorflow > 1.0, scipy, numpy and pillow


## Result of PSNR

The sample result of default parameter is here. You can have even better PSNR than below with using larger filters or deeper layers with our model.

| DataSet | Bicubic | SRCN | SelfEx | DRCN | VDSR | DCSCN (normal) | DCSCN (large) |
|:-------:|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Set5 x2|33.66|36.66|36.49|37.63|37.53|37.54|37.72|
|Set14 x2|30.24|32.42|32.22|33.04|33.03|33.02|33.15|
|BSD100 x2|29.56|31.36|31.18|31.85|31.90|31.88|32.03|

## Evaluate

Learned weights for some parameters are included in this GitHub. Execute **evaluate.py** with these args below and you get results in **output** directory. When you want to evaluate with other parameters, try training first then evaluate with same parameters as training have done. Results will be logged at log.txt, please check.

Three pre-trained models (compact, normal, large) are included.

```
# evaluating set14 dataset with normal model
python evaluate.py --test_dataset set14 --dataset yang_bsd_4 --filters_decay_gamma 1.5 --save_results True

# evaluating set5 dataset with compact model
python evaluate.py --test_dataset set5 --dataset yang_bsd_4 --save_results True --filters 32 --min_filters 8 --nin_filters 24 --nin_filters2 8

# evaluating all(set5,set14,bsd100) dataset with large model
python evaluate.py --test_dataset all --dataset yang_bsd_8 --layers 10 --filters 196 --min_filters 48 --last_cnn_size 3
```

## Apply to your own image

Place your image file in this project directory. And then run "sr.py --file 'your_image_file'" to apply Super Resolution. Results will be generated in **output** directory. Please note you should use same args which you used for training.

If you want to apply this model on your image001.png file, try those.

```
# apply super resoltion on image001.jpg (then see results at output directory)
python sr.py --file your_file.png --dataset yang_bsd_4 --filters_decay_gamma 1.5 

# apply super resoltion with compact model
python sr.py --file your_file.png --dataset yang_bsd_4 --filters 32 --min_filters 8 --nin_filters 24 --nin_filters2 8

# apply super resoltion with large model
python sr.py --file your_file.png --dataset yang_bsd_8 --layers 10 --filters 196 --min_filters 48 --last_cnn_size 3

# apply super resoltion with large model for scale x3
python sr.py --file your_file.png --dataset yang_bsd_8 --layers 10 --filters 196 --min_filters 48 --last_cnn_size 3 --scale 3
```

## How to train

You can train with any datasets. Put your image files as a training dataset into the directory under **data** directory, then specify with --dataset arg. There are some other hyper paramters to train, check [args.py](https://github.com/jiny2001/dcscn-super-resolution/blob/master/helper/args.py) to use other training parameters.

Each training and evaluation result will be added to **log.txt**.

```
# training with yang91 dataset
python train.py --dataset yang91

# training with larger filters and deeper layers
python train.py --dataset yang91 --filters 128 --layers 10

# after training has done, you can apply super resolution on your own image file. (put same args which you used on training)
python sr.py --file your_file.png --dataset yang91 --filters 128 --layers 10
```

## Data augmentation

To get a better performance, data augmentation is needed. You can use **augmentation.py** to build an augmented dataset. The arg, augment_level = 4, means it will add right-left, top-bottom and right-left and top-bottom fillped images to make 4 times bigger dataset. And there **yang91_4** directory will be generated as an augmented dataset.

To have better model, you should use larger training data like (BSD200 + Yang91) dataset.

```
# build 4x augmented dataset for yang91 dataset (will add flipped images)
python augmentation.py --dataset yang91 --augment_level 4

# build 8x augmented dataset for yang91 dataset (will add flipped and rotated images)
python augmentation.py --dataset yang91 --augment_level 8

# train with augmented data
python train.py --dataset yang91_4
```



## Visualization

During the training, tensorboard log is available. You can use "--save_weights True" to add histogram and stddev logging of each weights. Those are logged under **tf_log** directory.

Also we log average PSNR of traing and testing, and then generate csv and plot files under **graphs** directory. Please note training PSNR contains dropout factor so it will be less than test PSNR. This graph is from training our compact version of DCSCN.
